# Pi-Jarvis v1.0

**100% Offline Voice + Vision Assistant for Raspberry Pi 4**

## Quick Start

Pi-Jarvis is an always-on assistant that listens for "Parvis" [[memory:5211612]], processes your speech with local AI models, and responds entirely offline. It features intelligent intent recognition for timers, translations, time queries, weather info, and computer vision - all running as a production systemd service.

## Features

- üé§ **Hot-word Detection**: "Parvis" activation using Porcupine [[memory:5211612]]
- üó£Ô∏è **Speech-to-Text**: Real-time transcription with Whisper.cpp
- üß† **Local AI**: TinyLlama/Phi-3 models via llama.cpp/Ollama
- üîä **Text-to-Speech**: Fast response with eSpeak NG
- üëÅÔ∏è **Computer Vision**: Object detection with YOLOv8-n
- ‚ö° **Intent System**: Timers, translations, summaries, and more
- üöÄ **Auto-Start**: Systemd service for boot-time activation

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 (64-bit OS)
- USB microphone + speaker (or ReSpeaker 2-Mic HAT)
- Pi Camera v3
- 32GB+ micro-SD card
- Proper cooling (heatsink/fan)

## Installation

### Quick Production Deployment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prawal-Sharma/Parvis.git
   cd Parvis
   ```

2. **Install system dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git portaudio19-dev espeak espeak-data python3-venv python3-pip ffmpeg
   ```

3. **Set up Python environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install as system service**:
   ```bash
   ./systemd/install-service.sh
   ```

The installation script will:
- Set up the systemd service for auto-start on boot
- Configure health monitoring and log rotation
- Test the service installation
- Provide management commands

### Manual Testing (Without Hardware)

For development and testing without microphone/camera:
```bash
# Test intent system
python -m assistant.test_intents

# Run in simulation mode
python -m assistant.parvis simulation true
```

## Usage

### Service Management

Once installed, Pi-Jarvis runs automatically as a system service:

```bash
# Check service status
systemctl status pi-jarvis.service

# View live logs
journalctl -u pi-jarvis.service -f

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart pi-jarvis.service

# Stop service
sudo systemctl stop pi-jarvis.service
```

### Voice Commands

Say **"Parvis"** [[memory:5211612]] to activate, then try:

**Timer Commands:**
- "Set a timer for 5 minutes"
- "Start a 30 second timer"
- "Remind me in 2 hours"

**Time & Date:**
- "What time is it?"
- "What's today's date?"

**Translations:**
- "How do you say hello in Spanish?"
- "Translate water to French"
- "What is goodbye in German?"

**Vision:**
- "What do you see?"
- "Describe what's in front of you"
- "Look around and tell me what's there"

**Weather:**
- "What's the weather like?" (explains offline limitation)

### Health Monitoring

Pi-Jarvis includes comprehensive monitoring:

```bash
# Manual health check
./systemd/health-check.sh

# View health logs
tail -f /var/log/pi-jarvis/health-check.log

# Weekly status report
./systemd/status-report.sh
```

### Hardware-Free Testing

Perfect for development without mic/camera hardware [[memory:5211615]]:

```bash
# Interactive intent testing
python -m assistant.test_intents

# Text-only conversation mode  
python -m assistant.main text

# Full pipeline simulation
python -m assistant.parvis simulation true
```

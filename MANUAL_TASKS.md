  sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-pip ffmpeg
  ```

### Hardware Testing:
- [ ] **Test USB microphone**: Plug in and verify recognition
  ```bash
  arecord -l  # List audio input devices
  arecord -d 5 test.wav  # Record 5-second test
  aplay test.wav  # Playback test
  ```
- [ ] **Test speaker/audio output**: Verify sound works
  ```bash
  speaker-test -t wav -c 2  # Test stereo output
  espeak "Hello Pi-Jarvis"  # Test TTS
  ```
- [ ] **Test Pi Camera**: Ensure camera is detected and working
  ```bash
  libcamera-still -o test.jpg  # Capture test image
  ```
- [ ] **Check permissions**: Verify user can access audio/video devices
  ```bash
  groups $USER  # Should include audio, video groups
  ```

### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Confirm all Python packages installed without errors
- [ ] Test that virtual environment activates properly
- [ ] Verify no missing system dependencies

## üéØ **Phase 5: Hot-word Detection**

### Extensive Manual Testing Required:
- [ ] **"Hey Pi" training**: Test from different angles/distances
- [ ] **False positive testing**: Leave running for hours, monitor false triggers
- [ ] **Background noise testing**: TV, music, conversations nearby
- [ ] **Multiple voices**: Test with family members/friends if applicable
- [ ] **Edge case testing**: Whispering, shouting, accents

### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Reliable activation (>95% success rate)
- [ ] Low false positives (<1 per hour in normal environment)
- [ ] CPU usage stays around 1% when idle
- [ ] Quick response to wake word (<500ms)

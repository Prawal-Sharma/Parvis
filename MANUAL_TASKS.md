  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git
  sudo apt install -y libopenblas-dev portaudio19-dev espeak espeak-data
  sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-pip ffmpeg
  ```

### Hardware Testing:
- [ ] **Test USB microphone**: Plug in and verify recognition
  ```bash
  arecord -l  # List audio input devices
  arecord -d 5 test.wav  # Record 5-second test
  aplay test.wav  # Playback test
  ```
- [ ] **Test speaker/audio output**: Verify sound works
  ```bash
  speaker-test -t wav -c 2  # Test stereo output
  espeak "Hello Pi-Jarvis"  # Test TTS
  ```
- [ ] **Test Pi Camera**: Ensure camera is detected and working
  ```bash
  libcamera-still -o test.jpg  # Capture test image
  ```
- [ ] **Check permissions**: Verify user can access audio/video devices
  ```bash
  groups $USER  # Should include audio, video groups
  ```

### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Confirm all Python packages installed without errors
- [ ] Test that virtual environment activates properly
- [ ] Verify no missing system dependencies

---

## üîÑ **Phase 4: Complete Speech Pipeline**

### Critical Manual Testing:
- [ ] **End-to-end conversation testing**: Full voice-to-voice interaction
- [ ] **Response timing**: Measure total pipeline latency
- [ ] **Audio quality**: Ensure TTS is clear and natural
- [ ] **Conversation flow**: Test back-and-forth dialogue
- [ ] **Error recovery**: Test behavior with unclear speech

### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Total response time < 5 seconds (ideally < 3)
- [ ] Clear, understandable TTS output
- [ ] No audio feedback loops or echo
- [ ] Graceful handling of speech recognition errors

---

## üéØ **Phase 5: Hot-word Detection**

### Extensive Manual Testing Required:
- [ ] **"Hey Pi" training**: Test from different angles/distances
- [ ] **False positive testing**: Leave running for hours, monitor false triggers
- [ ] **Background noise testing**: TV, music, conversations nearby
- [ ] **Multiple voices**: Test with family members/friends if applicable
- [ ] **Edge case testing**: Whispering, shouting, accents

### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Reliable activation (>95% success rate)
- [ ] Low false positives (<1 per hour in normal environment)
- [ ] CPU usage stays around 1% when idle
- [ ] Quick response to wake word (<500ms)

---

## üëÅÔ∏è **Phase 6: Vision Integration**

### Manual Testing Required:
- [ ] **Camera positioning**: Find optimal angle and height
- [ ] **Lighting testing**: Various lighting conditions (bright, dim, backlit)
- [ ] **Object detection accuracy**: Test with various household items
- [ ] **Distance testing**: Near and far object recognition
- [ ] **Scene complexity**: Simple vs. cluttered environments

### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Accurate object identification (>80% for common items)
- [ ] Reasonable processing speed (~6 FPS)
- [ ] Good scene descriptions in natural language
- [ ] No camera crashes or freezes

## üéØ **Phase 7: Intent System**

### Manual Testing Required:
- [ ] **Voice command testing**: Try various phrasings for each intent
- [ ] **Timer functionality**: Set/cancel timers, test accuracy
- [ ] **Translation testing**: Test various language pairs
- [ ] **Weather/time queries**: Verify information accuracy
- [ ] **Intent classification**: Ensure system understands your requests

### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Intent recognition >90% accuracy
- [ ] All utility functions work as expected
- [ ] Graceful fallback for unrecognized intents
- [ ] Natural conversation flow maintained

  ```bash
  vcgencmd measure_temp  # Check CPU temperature
  ```
- [ ] **Resource monitoring**: Watch CPU, memory, disk usage
  ```bash
  htop  # System monitor
  df -h  # Disk usage
  ```
- [ ] **Error log monitoring**: Check for crashes or issues
  ```bash
  journalctl -u pi-jarvis -f  # Follow service logs
  ```

## ü§ù **How We'll Work Together**

### My Role:
- Write all the code and configuration files
- Set up the development environment and structure
- Provide commands and scripts for you to run
- Debug issues based on your feedback
- Optimize performance based on your testing results

### Your Role:
- Execute sudo commands and system-level changes
- Test hardware functionality (audio, camera, etc.)
- Provide feedback on voice recognition accuracy
- Test real-world performance and usability
- Verify that everything works in your specific environment
- Record final demo and documentation

### Communication:
- **Before each phase**: I'll tell you exactly what manual steps are needed
- **During testing**: Report any issues, errors, or unexpected behavior
- **After testing**: Let me know results so I can optimize or fix problems
